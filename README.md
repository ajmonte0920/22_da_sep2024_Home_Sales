# 22_da_sep2024_Home_Sales
HW 22 (SparkSql) for Data Science Bootcamp


# In this challenge, I successfully applied my knowledge of SparkSQL to analyze key metrics related to home sales data. I created temporary views, partitioned the data, cached and uncached a temporary table, and verified that the table was successfully uncached.

# The code sets up a Spark environment by installing Java, Spark, and necessary libraries. It initializes a SparkSession and loads home sales data from a CSV file into a DataFrame. The data is displayed and a temporary SQL view is created for querying. The SQL queries are executed and the results are rounded to two decimal places.
